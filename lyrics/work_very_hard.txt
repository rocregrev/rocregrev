Work Very Hard -------------------------------------------
verse:
oh we work very very hard sometimes
we're gonna work much harder yeah
and I know it seems very very tough sometimes
we're gonna pick our path
we're gonna pick our path
we're gonna give one thing get another in return

verse:
we'll get dirt on the soles of our feet
we'll get grime under our nails
I wanna move quick like lightning
but I'm moving like a snail

we'll get dirt on the soles of our feet
we'll get grime under our nails
I wanna move quick like lightning
but I'm moving like a snail

and I know we work very very hard sometimes
we're gonna work much harder yeah
and I know it seems very very tough sometimes
we're gonna pick our path
we're gonna pick our path
we're gonna give one thing get another in return

verse: 
and I know it seems very very tough
and i know it seems very tough sometimes
you wanna pick your path
we wanna pick our paths

very hard sometimes
very hard sometimes
very hard sometimes
very hard sometimes
