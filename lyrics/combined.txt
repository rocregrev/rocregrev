Work Very Hard -------------------------------------------
verse:
oh we work very very hard sometimes
we're gonna work much harder yeah
and I know it seems very very tough sometimes
we're gonna pick our path

we'll get dirt on the soles of our feet
we'll get grime under our nails
I wanna move quick like lightning
but I'm moving like a snail

we're gonna pick our path
we're gonna pick our path
we're gonna give one thing get another in return

Created a mask to fool lovers today
Play what is natural
Or be a Slave
Freedom fighters come again
Don't want to obey
Cause We see no Other way
Believe the soundboy deh never show his face
Another One dead never know his place 
Sing the song that's on the stereo and praise the name
No bother trod there in a deadmans game-play on yeah

chorus:
Badman and selector play another scorcher
For the righteous worker
Rudeboy you are a danger when music cross the border. the border
Yes we put Bad-mind and informer back against a corner
With this sound we a murder
Badman protector lead us to the water the water

breakdown:
The music make them cry Out
Won't you play the riddim forward again
Never will we tire
Never foolish, the sun it remains
Unno hold your lighter
We make them know how the thunder reigns
Can you make the fire
Testify don't leave them in chains

verse:(JOE)
We see them running for the border
See the wicked them afraid so they have to run for cover
They fear the sound that's taking over
And I can't take the pressure any longer no
Could have never learn
No matter how I tried
Badman a no hustle
And a Badman no right
Real hard-knock
Inna true western style
Badman a boss
And the dance fi gon wild
Come follow me
Fill up with sound and let the music play
Level out the bad and let the baseline slay
Free up the people from the worry and pain
When the people have it close then we just make it rain so
Become the liberator sufferer
With a lickle version them a conqueror

Badman and selector play another scorcher
For the righteous worker
Rudeboy you are a danger when music cross the border

Ginger Juice ----------------------------------------------------
verse:
I become what I put in myself
I can eat my way to good health
I sing songs of this blessing
and for gardens

this way the blessing is direct
my whole spirit I can protect
from my head down to my toe
only nature knows

hook:
only nature knows this one road to follow
you might as well abide like the river flow

verse:
operations of my brain
that no man can ever explain
so how would I be to know
what to feed it so

I do not have the recipe
it's out of reach to you and me
vegetables bless my soul
only nature knows

hook:
only nature knows it's like a river flow
you might as well abide
might as well abide

(instrumental)

hook:
like a river flow only nature knows
and you might as well abide
might as well abide, yeah
