Passion -------------------------------------------------
verse:
carry passion down a mountain
carry passion back out with you oh
carry passion down a mountain
carry passion back out

chorus:
hail from passion's door
and turn back them which seek more than their share
strike always to keep the balance
and your footing will be sure

verse:
carry bucket down a mountain AND
carry water back out with you oh
carry bucket down a mountain AND
carry water back out

chorus:
hail from passion's door
and turn back them which seek more than their share
strike always to keep the balance
and your footing will be sure

verse:
carry bucket down a mountain AND
carry water back out with you oh
carry passion down a mountain AND
carry passion back out

chorus:
hail from passion's door
and turn back them which seek more than their share
strike always to keep the balance
and your footing will be sure

hail from passion's door
take back them which seek more than their own
strike always to keep the balance
and your footing will be sure
