Ginger Juice ------------------------------------------
verse:
I become what I put in myself
I can eat my way to good health
I sing songs of this blessing
and for gardens

this way the blessing is direct
my whole spirit I can protect
from my head down to my toe
only nature knows

hook:
only nature knows this one road to follow
you might as well abide like the river flow

verse:
operations of my brain
that no man can ever explain
so how would I be to know
what to feed it so

I do not have the recipe
it's out of reach to you and me
vegetables bless my soul
only nature knows

hook:
only nature knows it's like a river flow
you might as well abide
might as well abide

(instrumental)

hook:
like a river flow only nature knows
and you might as well abide
might as well abide, yeah
